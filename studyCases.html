  <p class="">     Welcome to my UI/UX Designer College final project for a Card Game website called Teddies vs Monster, where we embark on an exciting journey to create an immersive and visually captivating experience for gamers. As a UI/UX designer, our mission is designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface that seamlessly blends functionality with aesthetics, ensuring a smooth and engaging journey from start to finish. Combining creativity, innovation, and a deep understanding of user behavior to bring this card game website to life.  Let's dive in!</p>

  <p>As for the first steps, i had to understand the needs and ideas of the client, and also study his Competitors, so i took the following steps:</p>

  <li>Meeting with the client;</li>
  <li>Research on the competitors;</li>
  <li>Creating a persona;</li>
  <li>Interview Target-market according to the personas;</li>
  <li>Creating IA and compering with competitor website IA;</li>
  <li>Wireframing;</li>
  <li>Follow-up meeting with client to align concepts and ideas;</li>
  <li>Mockup;</li>
  <li>Prototyping;</li>
  <li>Presenting to client the final project.</li>
</ol>
<p>After meeting with the client, i found out that what they wanted the most would be the biggest challenge for this project. They wanted a Design that mixed something DARK with a more FAMILY FRIENDLY approach, as in their creation process they decided to target both adults and younger kids. Mixing those 2 elements proved a bit hard, once i needed to find a common ground between Dark and Scary, but not so much it would be too much for the kids, but at the same time, would catch the attention of the kids.
  My idea to blend this 2 opposing targets was mixing Black and White with Colorful design. This way the website would have both elements well balanced.</p>

<p>For the personas, i created 2 different approach also seeking to follow the Clients Guide-lines and the results of my survey and research, 1 Board/card Game enthusiast and 1 person that never tried or had very few experiences with the gaming world. 
  That helped me and the client having a better view on how to move on with the project and the ideas that needed changing. </p>

<p>After 4 weeks of research, wireframing, lot of designing, and meeting with the clients, i created the final mockup with along side with a the prototype for the project, where i would usually use the Mobile-First Approach, the client had gave us instructions to start with the desktop, once it was a College Project and so there was a chance of lacking time to do both. However i got enough time to finish both, even though the mobile version have space for improvement. 
  Here is the mockup of the MAIN SCREEN on both version, and the link for the prototype is right in the bottom of the image.</p>
